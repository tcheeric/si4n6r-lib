# si4n6r-storage
A storage module for si4n6r. 
We define two _main_ operations: `store` and `retrieve`. 
 - The `store` operation, to save a user private key or an application metadata into the vault. 
 - The `retrieve` operation, to retrieve a user private key or an application metadata from the vault.
